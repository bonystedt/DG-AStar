DG A* Example
=============

Discription
-----------
This project is a small project I through together to play around with A* pathfinding. 

How To Use
----------
On the left side of the App are the controls and the legend, and on the right side of the App is the grid. In the Controls section, the "Reset" button will change the grid back to a default state. The "Find Path" button will find the path from the red node to the green node using A*, and the "Gen Obst" button will generate random obstacle chunks inside of the grid. Below the buttons are the brush settings. Next to the word current is the color of the current brush, and below that are four other colors corresponding to the other colors that you can paint onto the grid. You can paint on the grid by clicking on it and it will change the block under the mouse to the current brush type. The legend section contains information on what each color represents. The first four are the colors that you can place by clicking on the grid and the bottom three colors are using during pathfinding.
