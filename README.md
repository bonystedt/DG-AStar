DG A* Example
=============

Discription
-----------
This project is a small project I through together to play around with A* pathfinding. 

How To Use
----------
The controls and the legend are on the left side of the App, and on the right side is the grid. In the Controls section, the "Reset" button will change the grid back to a default state. The "Find Path" button will find the path from the red node to the green node using A*, and the "Gen Obst" button will generate random obstacle chunks inside of the grid. Below those buttons you will see the word "Current" and a colored block to the right. This block is the current brush color. And right below that are four other colors corresponding to the colors that you can paint onto the grid, click on any of these to change the current brush color. To paint onto the grid, click on the grid and the block below your click will change to the current brush color. The legend section explains what each color represents. The first four are the colors that you can place by clicking on the grid and the bottom three colors are used during pathfinding.
